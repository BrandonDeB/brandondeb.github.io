#### Feature: Researcher
When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.

3) I can’t keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else’s.
## Backstory
**STILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK**
Living in a time with the ZENO has been difficult for just about the entire world. (NAME) is not excluded. However, he's managed to make it work.

After travelling the South Blue, he has finally done it. (NAME) has finally figured out the best drugs from every kingdom within reach. Now, as with every drug, they come with side effects, but they feel damn good. Not only that, but some of the gases come with great powers. Namely, one kind can turn (NAME) into an abomination with incredibly combat skills.
## Crew Role
**CHOOSE ONE OF THESE**
#### Doctor
The ship's doctor is responsible for keeping track of the injuries and overall health of their crewmates and captain. They have a good understanding of medical science and procedures. They can perform surgeries, create medicine, and alleviate sickness or diseases.

Taking on the doctor role leaves you in charge of caring for your allies when they are hurt or in need of medical assistance. Skalds and Priests in particular may excel at completing these tasks.
##### Feature: Advanced Treatment
As a doctor, you are capable of understanding and analyzing all forms of medicine and medical treatments. You are proficient in using and administering antidotes, medicine, and other medical tools. When you use a healer’s kit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point. Additionally, when a creature is suffering from disease, blindness, deafness, paralysis, or poison, you can spend ฿400,000 to gather the medical supplies required to treat them and end one of these conditions over the course of 1 hour.
##### Pirate Prestige Ability: First Aid
When you take the doctor crew role, you are capable of stitching up wounds and providing first aid to yourself and your allies. You can spend 1 pirate prestige point as an action to restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to an injured creature, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this ability again until it finishes a short or long rest.
#### Navigator

The role of a navigator involves charting, mapping, and understanding the weather and conditions that they may encounter on their crew’s journey. The navigator is crucial to the ship effectively progressing to the next island or continent throughout the adventure. Without a decent navigator on board, the crew may end up lost for several days or weeks in dangerous waters.

Being a navigator means you must take responsibility for charting the crew’s course, making rolls to stay on course, and avoiding getting lost or stuck in storms and bad weather.

##### Role Skill Proficiency

As the navigator you have proficiency with Nature and Survival skills, Cartographer’s tools, and Navigator’s tools.

##### Feature: Charting and Mapping

A player that chooses the navigator role will actively aid in helping the crew along both in and out of character. With the DM’s assistance, you have the ability to physically map out and chart the course of the ship and nearby islands. Sometimes, you will be required to make various Wisdom or Intelligence skill checks to properly map out territories in more treacherous waters. Otherwise, this process should be effortless for your character under ordinary circumstances.

Additionally, you can assist in directing the ship on the right path. If the helmsman or captain is attempting to stay on course in the proper direction, you may assist them in rolling skill checks if you have properly analyzed the weather and map of the surrounding region.

##### Pirate Prestige Ability: Storm Tracking

In places like the grand line, fully understanding the weather and climate conditions is often incredibly difficult. However, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible for a talented navigator. In most situations, if you are about to run into dangerous weather or climates, the DM may warn the navigator in advance if they succeed on their skill checks. This may be done through subtle hints or simply describing what kind of weather is seen up ahead.

In some instances, the weather may appear so dangerous that it would cause a great deal of damage to the ship and crew if sailed through. If the navigator is unable to find a way around this, they may choose to expend 1 pirate prestige point to completely steer clear and avoid the storm or danger. It is possible that the storm may be exceptionally dangerous, so much so that 1 pirate prestige point won’t be enough to satisfy the condition and completely avoiding it. In this case, the DM may demand that you spend additional points to navigate around such a situation in the more extreme regions of the world.
#### Record-Keeper

The record-keeper is responsible for keeping record of the history, journals, and events while on board the ship. The record-keeper should be fairly knowledgeable and competent when it comes to any information such as when analyzing information, pieces of island history, and artifacts.

##### Role Skill Proficiency

As the record-keeper you have expertise with History and Religion skills.

##### Feature: Librarian of the Sea

Although being a record-keeper can involve working on a variety of different tasks and having many different goals and purposes on-board, most record-keepers is proficient in any form of note-keeping and information analysis. At the beginning of each session, the record-keeper may recap the previous session for all players to refresh their memories.

Additionally, the record-keeper can keep note of major quests, story points, and useful information regarding the lore the DM establishes throughout the campaign. The record-keeper may also add their proficiency bonus, on top of any other proficiency bonuses, to intelligence checks when it comes to analyzing any form of writing, artifact, puzzle, or piece of history.

##### Pirate Prestige Ability: Flash of Insight

When you take the record-keeper role, you can often tap into your nearly infinite pool of knowledge and mentally archived data. By spending 1 pirate prestige point, you can discover one major clue, detail, or other piece of information about a puzzle, artifact, or form of writing. Your DM might give you a major hint or advantage on a roll to discover something vital.
